   <summary><b>History of Craftsmanship</b></summary><br/>

   With this topic, you'll learn about how craftsmanship has been applied across different trades, cultures, and periods in human history.

   #### Learning Outcomes
   * Summarize the history of craftsmanship

      <p>The guilds started as a way for merchants and artisans to protect their craft. They would form these guilds, with the intent of protecting their craft and ensuring that quality remained high. They were used almost as a secret society that monitored their members, in a way to ensure that there was a standard. The guilds were also used to keep out competition that did not either join the guild or receive permission from them first (and paid a fee). Some guilds received very young men who were brought in and taught the trade gradually over time.</p>

   * Critique ancient craftsmanship patterns and describe some of their benefits and drawbacks

      <p><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Quality was monitored and ensured that everything produced met the same standard set by the guilds</li><li>The guilds provided a great support system for other members that sometimes went beyond the craft</li><li>The guilds increased economic tranquility within the community because they would strike deals with other crafts that stated a member would have to buy only certain types of material from certain members of the community</li><li>Members of the guilds did not have to often fear competition from non-members as the guild did not allow such activity without permission(and payment)</li><li>The apprenticeship programs allowed for easy training (and monitoring) to ensure that the craft of the trade was kept and that quality was ensured to meet the standard set by the guild</li><li>Because of the way the guilds ensured quality, they also were akin to garner a good reputation amongst the community it served within and some neighboring communities</li></ul></p>

      <p><h3>Drawbacks</h3><ul><li>While the guilds helped to ensure high quality of goods, the way they handled outside competition, it limited the progress of their craft. They would resist new ideas that disrupted their order of doing things</li><li>Most guilds had somewhat monopolistic approaches that can also be harmful to innovative ideas</li></ul></p>

   * Propose how craftsmanship might apply to modern society

      <p>I am breaking this question down into 2 parts. First will be observations in the Business world as a whole. Then, we will dive more into society roles.<ul><h3>Business</h3><li>Lots of companies now have enacted apprenticeship or "earn-as-you-learn" programs to teach new employees more about the craft of the business. This is done in a mutual way because the employee is gaining some financial compensation, as well as learning, while the company can get an employee at lower market value, while training them to master a specific task to better impact the business</li><li>The Shokunin, while not entirely the same, shares many similarities with the traditional assembly line. One individual becomes incredibly skilled at their one task, which is just a piece of the whole process</li></ul></p>

      <p><h3>Society</h3><ul><li>In regards with shokunin, society has parts that are constantly working on improvement and spending a lifetime trying to improve. People who workout and the Buddhist monks of sri lanka are 2 such examples. Bodybuilders spend many years of their life trying to constantly improve their physical being, while the monks spend a lifetime trying to achieve spiritual growth.</li><li>Some parts of society use craftsmanship as a way to maintain their culture, such as the native tribes of alaska. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/native-artisans-alaska-innovation-humor-craft-180976519/">Smithsonian Article</a></li><li>Some sanctions of The free masons still use many of the principles that were used by 13th century stonemason guilds.</li></ul></p>

   <summary><b>Principles of Modern Craftsmanship</b></summary><br/>

   With this topic, you'll learn about the principles of modern craftsmanship and how they can be utilized in any occupation.

   #### Learning Outcomes
   * List the principles of modern craftsmanship

      <p><ul><li>To have a deep passion for what you are creating, as the end user is not the creator itself but the customer</li><li>To embrace the suck. Working will have its painful moments, whether that is growing pains or pain for work that isn't thrilling.</li><li>Focus your success on everyday improvement. It is easy to judge success based on completion of projects, or things "outside the norm", but real success starts with the changing of the success mindset.</li><li>To have some originality in your craft and become a resource and inspiration to others.</li></ul></p>

   * Compare the craftsmanship mindset to the contemporary approach to work

      <p><ul><li>The contemporary mindset follows the pattern of one-way to do things, as to reach mass production. The craftsman mindset is using all the tools at the disposal to creatively engineer many ways of achieving a the desired result.</li><li>The contemporary approach is also one in which things are produced with generally low product-life cycles, whereas a craftsman builds something with the intent that it will outlive the creator.</li><li>To reiterate, the contemporary approach is to produce in mass, as much as possible, with enough care to last around 3-5 years average. The craftsmanship mindset is different where the goal is to build something with passion to see it grow and endure longevity.</li></ul></p>

   * Explain what craftsmanship means to you and how you might apply it in your work

      <p><ul><li>Craftsmanship to me means having a "growth mindset". It means to take your passion and not just do the basic but always put your best in any project and build something that will outlive me.</li><li>It means developing a sort of perfectionism attitude that can only be truly achieved by being a valuable resource to others.</li></ul></p>

      <p><ul><li>Although I am quite new to the developer lifestyle, I can still find ways to apply it to there as well as other aspects of my life. </li></ul></p>
         <h3>Developer</h3>
            <p><ul><li>I can start to give my projects full attention and continue to build off old ones, with new things I've learned.</li><li>I can unlearn the contemporary mindset that has been instilled in me and begin progressing towards the craftsmanship mindset</li><li>I can reach out to community members and begin to spread the word of this program, and what craftsmanship is really about</li></ul></p>
         <h3>Other Aspects of Life</h3>
            <p><ul><li>I can give every passion that I have, all the attention to detail it is needed.</li><li>I can have a "growth mindset" in any endeavor I have, with the aim to make progress everyday, and eventually get to the point where I can teach others.</li></ul></p>

   * Theorize why the pursuit of craftsmanship leads to a higher quality of work

      <p><ul><li>I think the pursuit of craftsmanship leads to a higher quality of work because you are making an active choice to progress and perfect your craft everyday.</li><li>I think it can also be a signature of pride and become an embodiment of an individual. It eventually becomes a lifestyle, not just a mindset that you garner when you work, but something that you carry with you in your daily life.</li><li>When you develop a high passion to perfect something, you find an enjoyment in the process of it all, good and bad, not just the result. I think most can agree that happy workers tend to be more efficient.</li></ul></p>
