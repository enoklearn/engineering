# Exercise: Product-Market Fit Indicator Questionnaire

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | To give an apprentice a tool to discover where a business may be on its journey toward PMF. |
| Duration | 1-4 hours |

As you look to acclimate as an apprentice to a new business, business line, or product, you need to first get an idea of your place in the larger story of the business and its place in the market that it seeks to serve. Starting with an understanding of where a business is at on its journey toward PMF will help any new team member empathize with the goals of the business at its current stage. 

This questionnaire will give you a bank of questions to 1) understand the value proposition of the product your business seeks to use to solve a strong market demand, and 2) to gauge if the business model around the product/market need is sustainable and scalable 

These are good questions to ask of a "manager," likely a "product" or "project manager," as they typically sit at the crossroads of the business and the product team. If there is not a PM accessible, see if it is possible to interview a combination of the following to piece together the story:
 - product designer
 - business analysts
 - lead developer
 - sales/business development rep
 - CTO/CPO 

## Steps

1. Set up a calendar invite with who you intend to interview. If you don't know who to talk to, ask your mentor about a good first candidate to connect with and go from there.

2. Use the following questions and accompanying rationale to help guide your conversation.
**Tip** - Be sure to capture notes during your interview for future reference and for recapping with your mentor. Also, see if you can ask for permission to record a remote conversation for revisiting later.

3. From your interview(s), which of the following would most closely describe the step of the journey your business is at on its way to PFM: "Pre Product-Market Fit," "Close to Product-Market Fit," or "Past Product-Market Fit."

## Questions

Use the following questions to guide you during the exercise:

<details>
  <summary>What market or target user are you out to serve?</summary>
  
  - This states the "who" the business is out to serve
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is their typical "day in the life" or their "jobs to be done" that we are trying to support?</summary>
  
  - This helps us to start to empathize with the customers' workflow that the business is out to support with their product
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What pain point or opportunity are we looking to specifically support?</summary>
  
  - This helps us understand the focus and the "why" of what the business is doing
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is our current way of addressing the target user's problem/opportunity?</summary>
  
  - This could vary from whiteboard drawings to prototypes to working software
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the current reaction to this solution?</summary>
  
  - This will pull out general perceptions of possible metrics like "net promoter scores" or "adoption/conversion rates"
</details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Is there visible excitement in potential customers when this solution is verbalized, shown or used?</summary>
  
  - This would help us see if the idea/product has struck a nerve to a "mission-critical" problem and not just a "small nuisance" of a problem
</details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Are people currently paying for the product, or have they paid ahead of time for the product being currently built?</summary>
  
  - Nothing is a better signal of interest than if you can get people to put money down to say that they need your product
</details>
 
<details>
  <summary>If the product is built and in production, what does user retention look like?</summary>
  
  - Post MVP release, if a retention curve of a cohort of users eventually flattens out, this is a good indication that you've found PMF for those that have remained
  - If the retention rate of a comparable product is known, is your rate close to it?
</details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Does the revenue from retained users cover the costs of product production and acquisition of new customers?</summary>
  
  - If the answer is yes, they are on the way to a sustainable business model
  - If no, then more discovery is needed to reach profitability
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do users say they'd be very disappointed if your product went away?</summary>
  
  - If 40% or more of customers would say they are "very disappointed" if your product went away, then there is likely PMF (out of the options of 1. "Not disappointed," 2. "Somewhat disappointed," or 3. "Very disappointed")
</details>

<details>
  <summary>If there is a free trial to potential customers, what is the conversion rate from free trial to paid?</summary>
  
  - If users aren't "screaming" when the free trial is pulled, then they are NOT desperate, and you probably have not scratched a "mission-critical" problem for them
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the biggest source of leads for your product? ("exponential organic growth")</summary>
  
 - If "referral" or "word of mouth" (organic growth) is the predominant source, then you're likely at PMF.
 - Ideally, 50% or more of your customers come from organic growth
 - If it's a SaaS product, and big-name brands are using your product, there is likely PMF
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is the company making more than it is spending? (cost-efficient growth)</summary>
  
  - If a company burns $2M to sell $1M in annual recurring revenue (ARR), it is more impressive than a company that spends $5M to sell $1M in ARR. The prior feels more like the market is pulling product out of the company, and the latter feels like the company is pushing the product into the market.
  - Is the sales team bringing in more revenue than their cost to put them in the field? If so, then you're getting near PMF.
  - Is the lifetime value (LFV) of a customer more than the cost to acquire a customer (CAC)? If so, then you're likely at PMF. This points to there are enough customers out there, and you can efficiently bring them in, or there is enough virality/content out there to drive sustainable acquisitions.
</details>
 
<details>
  <summary>Is there a noticeable effect of product defects, friction, or downtime on customer retention or adoption trends?</summary>
  
  - If you have sustainable retention even with defects, it's a sign you're close to PMF
</details>
