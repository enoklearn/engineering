# Exercise: Assessing the Stage of your Product

## Goal
To help an apprentice uncover the stage of the product they’ll be working on, and how that stage effects the software development strategies their products teams choose

## Overview
From the prior two topic exercises, the apprentice has now likely uncovered 1) where the business is at on its journey to product-market fit and 2) how that then has influenced the stage the company is now at. Based on the company’s stage, we now turn our attention to assessing the influence the company stage has on the goals the business places on the product and how then the product teams decide to build and maintain it.

This exercise will consist of conversations and reviewing the current product planning documentation in order to help further develop the apprentice’s mental image of the larger context that the business is in, what role the apprentice will play in it all, and the rationale behind how the product development teams currently prioritize different software development strategies.

This exercise will guide the apprentice in uncovering what stage they assess the product to be in, and will even stretch the apprentice to consider if how the company sees its product, along with its current goals, is in harmony with their company stage.

## Duration
1-4 hours (depending on how many interviews and document reviews it takes to gauge the product’s stage)

## Supporting Roles
A “manager” role on a product team will likely know where to look in uncovering where the company stores its product charter/planning documentation. If there is not a “manager” associated with a team, then might the mentor or another leadership role know if these documents exist and where they are stored?

## Steps/Description
In uncovering how the business prioritizes and sets the goals of its product(s), first reading articles/documentation written by the business, or its product teams, is an easy way to quickly assimilate.

**Step 1** - Ask your mentor or a “manager” on your team if the following types of documents exist, and if so, where they live:
- “Product Value Proposition” - documents that outline, at the highest level, what customer your product seeks to serve, what their goals and pain points are in their workflow, and how your product plans to offer the value your customers need. Examples include:
  - Value Proposition Canvas
  - Business Model Canvas
  - Lean Startup Canvas
  - User Journey Map

- “Product Strategy” - documents that outline the vision of your product and the strategy of how they plan to get there. Examples include:
  - Product Charter
  - Product Roadmap
  - Product Wireframes 
  - Product Release Plan
  - Story Maps

**Step 2** - Read these documents, keeping in mind the described goals of each product stage below: 
- **New Product** - The goal is to create the first version of the product, or the **minimal viable product (MVP)**, and to **remain low cost and nimble** to likely changing feature ideas as assumptions about the target users are rapidly prototyped, tested and validated.
- **Growth** - The goal is to have a product that can **scale to sustain a large increase of usage** as many new customers are coming to use the product, while also **enhancing the user experience** of the features that are most used from the MVP or **pruning features** that have not been essential.
- **Product Expansion** - The goal is to identity and **keep the core of the product stable and flexible** to allow for capturing new market verticals with new needs, or the mainstream needs of the current market, through the addition of fresh functionality on top of the core features or through “platform” or “white-labeling” efforts.
- **Harvesting** - The goal is to **ensure uptime, ease of maintenance, ease of use, and to keep risk low** so as to not disrupt the product’s brand, its promises, its reputation, or the consistent revenue coming in from the “cash cow” product, all while responding quickly to customer feedback.
- **End-of-Life** - The goal is to **keep brand and SLA promises to the end**, and to **ensure minimal disruption** to stakeholders as services/features are transitioned or brought offline.

**Step 3a** - Based on the collective knowledge gathered from the suggested documents above, is there enough there for the apprentice to assess what stage the product is at? If so, proceed to step 4. If not, go to Step 3b.

**Step 3b** - If these documents don’t exist, or don’t paint a definitive enough picture of the product’s goals, what gaps are present? 
- Might you create a few simple questions to pull out the necessary understanding to fill in these gaps?
  - If you can’t formulate these questions, might you invite your mentor or team “manager” to help you formulate these questions? 
- Might you ask your team’s “manager” or your mentor these questions first?
- If there are any questions they cannot answer, who might your mentor or “manager” recommend you talk with next?

**Step 4** - Now that you have enough of the large picture of the current state of the product in view, look to answer these following questions:
- Based on your new understanding of business’s goals for the product, what stage would **you** expect the product to be at in order to align its efforts correctly to the stage of the company?
- Now, based on your review of the product's value proposition and strategy documentation, and from potential interviews, which of the five product stages would you say best describes the product stage the **company itself** would say it's at?
- Have both of these questions above produced the same product stage? If so, what does that tell you about the business you serve? 
  - If not, what does that tell you? What further conversions might you have to offer this needed feedback?

**Step 5** - Now that you’ve likely assessed the stage of the product you’ll be serving to build, let’s shift our focus to understand then how this stage has influenced which software development strategies your product teams have chosen to build, test, deploy, and maintain the product.

Use the following example software development strategies and influencers to guide a conversation with your mentor:
- CI/CD
- Automated Testing Coverage
- TDD
- Deployment Environments
- Microservices
- Compliance (PCI, HIPAA, etc.)
- Accessibility

Use the following questions to help guide the conversation with your mentor, or even a group of software development leaders your mentor may arrange, to help undercover the rationale behind the current development strategies and product infrastructure:

- Does this list spur on any other strategies, influencers, or “cross-roads decisions” that we should also consider in our conversation? 
- Based on the stage of our product, which of the list have we adhered to? How do we implement them today? 
  - How is our implementation going? What was learned from this effort? What next steps are we considering? 
  - What was the rationale behind using these strategies from the list? 
  - Does the current stage of the product support these strategies? (refer to the goals of the product stages for context/comparison)
- What items from the list have we not taken on or adhered to? 
  - What was the rationale behind us avoiding the use of these items from the list?
  - What factors would need to be in place for us to consider using/adhering to these items? 
  - Does the current stage of the product support the avoidance of these items? (refer to the goals of the product stages for context/comparison)

## Demo/Reflection
Depending on the cadence that’s been worked out between the mentor and apprentice, look to use the following questions to guide a self-reflection  or a discussion together:
- What conclusion can you share with/show your mentor?
- What surprised you about this exercise?
- How would you say this exercise stretched you? 
- What did this exercise show you about yourself?
- If you were to mentor someone in the future, what highlights would you make sure they captured from this exercise? 
- How did this exercise build upon the learning outcomes from this topic? What would you change about the exercise to better suit your context for the next apprentice?
- What did this leave you excited to dig further into? 
- Where do you want to go from here?
- What would be your next step? What resources can support you in this next step?
- When you connect with your mentor after this next step, what do you hope to share with them? To celebrate?
