# Exercise: Runtime Mismatch

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Explore running source code using different language runtime versions |
| Duration | 1-2 hours |


## Steps

Use the following steps to help you progress through the exercise (use your own judgement, these are not precise steps):

1. Install `pyenv` on your machine (or another runtime manager)
2. Check the version of Python that you have installed, and make sure it starts with `v2`
3. Open the Python REPL and evaluate `print 'Hello', 'World!'`
4. Change your version of Python to `v3`
5. Repeat step 3
6. Share the results with your mentor!

## Questions

Use these questions to guide your curiosity during the exercise:

- What is a REPL?
- What broke between the Python versions?
- Why is version compatibility so important?
- How might you keep track of breaking changes using semantic versioning?
