# Exercise: Defining Features

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Describe three features for your umbrella project as user stories with acceptance criteria and strategize how you might convert the acceptance criteria to unit tests |
| Duration | 2-3 hours |

Example pseudo test code:

```
it ("should __________ when __________")
it ("should process user payment when 'pay now' button is pressed")
```

## Steps

Use the following steps to help you progress through the exercise (use your best judgment, these are not precise steps):

1. Create user stories for three new features in your umbrella project
2. Define the acceptance criteria of these features
3. (optional) Create a [Figma](https://figma.com) prototype visually showing what these features do
4. Create pseudo test code based on the acceptance criteria of your features
5. Share with your mentor

## Questions

Use these questions to guide your curiosity during the exercise:

- How do you know the features you're creating are valuable to your users?
- What makes a good user story?
- Why might visual prototypes be useful?

## Reflection

Use the following questions to reflect on what you learned with this exercise and discuss with your mentor:
