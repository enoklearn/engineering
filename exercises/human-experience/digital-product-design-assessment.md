# Exercise: Digital Product Design Assessment

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Explain the pros and cons of your favorite digital product. Analyze the experience, and call out things that are designed well or not so well, focusing on both the user interface and user experience of the product. |
| Tools/Material | Paper & pencil or a digital document (like a Google doc or Notion page) |
| Duration | 1-2 hours |


## Steps

1. Grab a piece of paper or start a digital document; you're going to be taking notes!
2. Pick your favorite digital products, something like Instagram, Github, Slack, or a workout app, anything. It should be something that you know well, though, and use regularly.
3. Take a minute to reflect on your selected product, and write down what you think the goal of the product is. For example, Github's might be to *help developers and teams manage their code*. It doesn't have to be perfect, just as long as it's close.
4. Now, go through the product and see how well it solves that problem. For instance, does Github help you manage your code well, and why? Write down your observations.
5. After that, try thinking about ways it falls short and maybe even works against helping users accomplish the outlined goal. Write down your observations.
6. The next thing to do is turn your attention to the interface. Note your observations, good or bad. Think about things like; are buttons adequately sized and easy to reach, or is a text easy to read, or is the use of color good (appealing and accessible).
7. Call out any other observations that you find interesting as well!
8. Grab your mentor and discuss!
