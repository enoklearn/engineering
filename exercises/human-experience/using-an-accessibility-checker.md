# Exercise: Using an Accessibility Checker

## Overview

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Goal | Learn how to use an accessibility plugin to run audits and pin point areas of improvement for a website’s accessibility. |
| Tools/Material | An accessibilty checker tool *(we recommend selecting from [IBM's Accessibility ToolKit](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/))* |
| Duration | < 1 hour |

## Steps

1. Install an accessibly checker plugin in your browser from IBM’s Accessibly toolkit. Here are some links to help you get started:
    - [Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ibm-equal-access-accessib/lkcagbfjnkomcinoddgooolagloogehp)
    - [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/accessibility-checker/)
2. Once the plugin is installed, go to any popular website that you like to use in your browser. Try to pick something with a good amount going on within it, don’t just go to the basic [google.com](http://google.com) search bar page. 
3. Now, use your new browser plugin and run an accessibly scan. 
4. Take a moment to click around, and understand the report and its suggestions. 
    1. Take a screenshot or download the report for that site. 
5. Next, go to another website that you know, but is not as popular. 
6. Run another scan with the accessibly plug-in. 
7. Do the same thing, understand the report, and screenshot/download it. 
8. Lastly, compare and contrast the two sites and their results, noting anything interesting. 
9. Go grab your mentor, and discuss your findings!  

## Reflection

Use or tweak these questions, and use them as prompts to guide a conversation of the exercise’s output between the apprentice and the mentor:

- How did each website score? 
- Discuss some of the violations, and ways each website could improve. 
- What conclusion can you share with your mentor?
- What surprised you about this exercise?
- Where do you want to go from here?
